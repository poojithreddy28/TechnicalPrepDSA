# # Discuss: what are the similarities between the two solutions? What are the differences?

# Problem 4: Calculating Groot's Growth
# Groot grows according to a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Given n, find the height of Groot after n months using a recursive method.

# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

# Problem 5: Calculating the Power of the Fantastic Four
# The superhero team, The Fantastic Four, are training to increase their power levels. Their power level is represented as a power of 4. Write a recursive function that calculates the power of 4 raised to the nth power to determine their training level.

# Problem 6: Strongest Avenger

# Problem 7: Counting Vibranium Deposits
# In Wakanda, vibranium is the most precious resource, and it is found in several deposits. Each deposit is represented by a character in a string (e.g., "V" for vibranium, "G" for gold, etc.)

# Given a string resources, write a recursive function count_deposits() that returns the total number of distinct vibranium deposits in resources.

        else:
            return count_deposits(resources[1:])
# Example Usage:

print(count_deposits("VVVVV"))
print(count_deposits("VXVYGA"))
# Example Output:

# 5
# 2
# Example 2 Explanation: There are two characters "V" in the string "VXVYGA", 
# therefore there are two vibranium deposits in the string.
