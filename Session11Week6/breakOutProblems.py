# # # Standard Problem Set Version 1
# # # Problem 1: Building a Playlist
# # # The assignment statement to the top_hits_2010s variable below creates the linked list Uptown Funk -> Party Rock Anthem -> Bad Romance. Break apart the assignment statement into multiple lines with one call to the Node constructor per line to recreate the list.

# # class SongNode:
# # 	def __init__(self, song, next=None):
# # 		self.song = song
# # 		self.next = next

# # # For testing
# # def print_linked_list(node):
# #     current = node

# # top_hits_2010s = SongNode("Uptown Funk", SongNode("Party Rock Anthem", SongNode("Bad Romance")))
# # # Example Usage:

# # print_linked_list(top_hits_2010s)
# # # Example Output:

# # # Uptown Funk -> Party Rock Anthem -> Bad Romance


# # Problem 2: Top Artists
# # Given the head of a linked list playlist, return a dictionary that maps each artist in the list to its frequency.

# # Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# # class SongNode:
# # 	def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
# # 		self.song = song
# # 		self.artist = artist
# # 		self.next = next

# # # For testing
# # def print_linked_list(node):
# #     current = node
# #     while current:
# #         print((current.song, current.artist), end=" -> " if current.next else "")
# #         current = current.next
# #     print()


# # def get_artist_frequency(playlist):
# # 	artistCount = {}
# # 	current = playlist
# # 	while current:
# # 		if current.artist in artistCount:
# # 			artistCount[current.artist]+=1
# # 		else:
# # 			artistCount[current.artist]=1
# # 		current = current.next
# # 	print(artistCount)

# # # Example Usage:
# # playlist = SongNode("Saturn", "SZA", 
# #                 SongNode("Who", "Jimin", 
# #                         SongNode("Espresso", "Sabrina Carpenter", 
# #                                 SongNode("Snooze", "SZA"))))
# # #print_linked_list(playlist)
# # get_artist_frequency(playlist)
# # # Example Output:

# # # { "SZA": 2, "Jimin" : 1, "Sabrina Carpenter": 1}


# # Problem 3: Glitching Out
# # The following code attempts to remove the first node with a given song from a singly linked list with head playlist_head but it contains a bug!

# # Step 1: Copy this code into Replit.

# # Step 2: Create your own test cases to run the code against, and use print statements and the stack trace to identify and fix the bug so that the function correctly removes a node by value from the list.

# # Step 3: Evaluate the time and space complexity of the fixed solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe the solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# class SongNode:
# 	def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
# 		self.song = song
# 		self.artist = artist
# 		self.next = next

# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(node):
#     current = node
#     while current:
#         print((current.song, current.artist), end=" -> " if current.next else "")
#         current = current.next
#     print()


# # Function with a bug!
# def remove_song(playlist_head, song):
#     if not playlist_head:
#         return None
#     if playlist_head.song == song:
#         return playlist_head.next

#     current = playlist_head
#     while current.next:
#         if current.next.song == song:
#             current.next = current.next.next  
#             return playlist_head 
#         current = current.next

#     return playlist_head
# # Example Usage:

# playlist = SongNode("SOS", "ABBA", 
#                 SongNode("Simple Twist of Fate", "Bob Dylan",
#                     SongNode("Dreams", "Fleetwood Mac",
#                         SongNode("Lovely Day", "Bill Withers"))))

# print_linked_list(remove_song(playlist, "Dreams"))

# # # Expected Output:

# # ('SOS', 'ABBA') -> ('Simple Twist of Fate', 'Bob Dylan') -> ('Lovely Day', 'Bill Withers')


# Problem 4: On Repeat
# A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates.

# We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the head of a linked list playlist_head, return True if the playlist has a cycle in it and False otherwise. A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# class SongNode:
# 	def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
# 		self.song = song
#         self.artist = artist
# 		self.next = next

# def on_repeat(playlist_head):
# 	pass
# # Example Usage:

# # Linked list of four songs, with fourth song pointing to second song

# song1 = SongNode("GO!", "Common")
# song2 = SongNode("N95", "Kendrick Lamar")
# song3 = SongNode("WIN", "Jay Rock")
# song4 = SongNode("ATM", "J. Cole")
# song1.next = song2
# song2.next = song3
# song3.next = song4
# song4.next = song2

# print(on_repeat(song1))
# Example Output:

# True


# Problem 5: Looped
# Given the head of a linked list playlist_head that may contain a cycle, use the fast and slow pointer method to return the length of the cycle. If the list does not contain a cycle, return 0.

# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# class SongNode:
# 	def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
# 		self.song = song
# 		self.artist = artist
# 		self.next = next

# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(node):
#     current = node
#     while current:
#         print((current.song, current.artist), end=" -> " if current.next else "")
#         current = current.next
#     print()

# def loop_length(playlist_head):
#     length = 0
# 	slow = playlist_head
# 	fast = playlist_head
# 	while fast and fast.next:
# 		slow = slow.next
# 		fast = fast.next.next
# 		length += 1
# 		if slow == fast:
# 			return length
# 	return 0
# # Example Usage:

# # Linked list of four songs, with fourth song pointing to second song

# song1 = SongNode("Wein", "AL SHAMI")
# song2 = SongNode("Si Ai", "Tayna")
# song3 = SongNode("Qalbi", "Yasser Abd Alwahab")
# song4 = SongNode("La", "DYSTINCT")
# song1.next = song2
# song2.next = song3
# song3.next = song4
# song4.next = song2

# print(loop_length(song1))
# # Example Output:

# # 3


# Problem 6: Volume Control
# You are working as an engineer normalizing volume levels on songs. Given the head of a singly linked list with integer values song_audio representing volume levels at different points in a song, return the number of critical points. A critical point is a local minima or maxima.

# The head and tail nodes are not considered critical points.
# A node is a local minima if both the next and previous elements are greater than the current element
# A node is a local maxima if both the next and previous elements are less than the current element
# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# class Node:
# 	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
# 		self.value = value
# 		self.next = next

# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(head):
#     current = head
#     while current:
#         print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
#         current = current.next

# def count_critical_points(song_audio):
# 	prev_dummy = Node(float("inf"))
# 	current = song_audio
# 	critical_points = 0
# 	while current.next:
# 		if prev_dummy.value > current.value and current.next.value > current.value:
# 			critical_points += 1
# 		elif prev_dummy.value < current.value and current.next.value < current.value:
# 			critical_points += 1
# 		prev_dummy = current
# 		current = current.next
# 	return critical_points
# # Example Usage:

# # song_audio linked list

# song_audio = Node(5, Node(3, Node(1, Node(2, Node(5, Node(1, Node(2)))))))

# print(count_critical_points(song_audio))
# Example Output:

# 3
# Explanation: There are three critical points:
# - The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
# - The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
# - The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
# ðŸ’¡ Hint: Which technique?
