# # Problem 1: Player Class
# # Step 1: Copy the following code into your IDE.

# # Step 2: Instantiate an instance of the class Player and store it in a variable named player_one.

# # The Player object should have the character "Yoshi" and the kart "Super Blooper".
# class Player():
#     def __init__(self, character, kart):
#         self.character = character
#         self.kart = kart
#         self.items = []
# player  = Player("Yoshi","Super Blooper")
# print(player.character)
# print(player.kart)
# print(player.items)

# # Example Usage:

# # player_one.character
# # player_one.kart
# # player_one.items
# # Example Output:

# # Yoshi
# # Super Blooper
# # []



# Problem 1: Calculate Tournament Placement
# In the Player class below, each player has a race_outcomes attribute which holds a list of integers describing what place they came in for each race in a tournament.

# Write a method get_tournament_place() that takes in one parameter, opponents, a list of other player objects also participating in the tournament, and returns the place in the overall tournament.

# Rank in the tournament is determined by the lowest average race outcome. (1st place is better than 2nd!)
# Each opponent in opponents is guaranteed to have participated in the same number of races as the current player.
# class Player:
#     def __init__(self, character, kart, outcomes):
#         self.character = character
#         self.kart = kart
#         self.items = []
#         self.race_outcomes = outcomes

#     # def get_tournament_place(self, opponents):
#     #     dict = {}
#     #     dict[self.character] = sum(self.race_outcomes)/len(self.race_outcomes)
#     #     # low = dict[self.character]
#     #     for opponent in opponents:
#     #         avg = sum(opponent.race_outcomes)/len(opponent.race_outcomes)
#     #         dict[opponent.character] = avg
#     #         # low = min(low, avg)   
#     #     sorted_dict = sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
#     #     for i in range(len(sorted_dict)):
#     #         if sorted_dict[i]==self.character:
#     #             return i + 1

          
# # Example Usage:

# player1 = Player("Mario", "Standard", [1, 2, 1, 1, 3])
# player2 = Player("Luigi", "Standard", [2, 1, 3, 2, 2])
# player3 = Player("Peach", "Standard", [3, 3, 2, 3, 1])

# opponents = [player2, player3]
# print(player1.get_tournament_place(opponents))
# # Example Output:

# # 1 
# # Explanation: Mario/player1's average place is 1.6, Luigi's is 2.0, and Peach's is 2.4


# # Problem 2: Update Linked List Sequence
# # A linked list is a data structure that allows us to store pieces of data sequentially, similar to a normal list or array. The key difference between a linked list and a normal list is how each element is stored in a computerâ€™s memory.

# # In a normal list, individual elements are stored in adjacent memory locations according to their order in the list. If we know where the first element is stored, it's easy to access any other element in the list.

# # In a linked list, individual elements, called nodes, are not stored in sequential memory locations. Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes into a sequential list, each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

# # Using the provided Node class and the linked list below, update the current linked list shy_guy -> diddy_kong -> dry_bones to shy_guy -> link -> diddy_kong -> toad -> dry_bones.

# # A function print_linked_list() that accepts the head, or first element, of a linked list and prints the values of the list has also been provided for testing purposes.

# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, value, next=None):
#         self.value = value
#         self.next = next

# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(head):
#     current = head
#     while current:
#         print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
#         current = current.next

# shy_guy = Node("Shy Guy")
# diddy_kong = Node("Diddy Kong")
# dry_bones = Node("Dry Bones")
# shy_guy.next = diddy_kong
# diddy_kong.next = dry_bones

# link = Node("Link")
# shy_guy.next = link
# link.next = diddy_kong
# toad = Node("Toad")
# diddy_kong.next = toad
# toad.next = dry_bones
# # # Add code to update the list here
# # Example Usage:

# print("Current List:")
# print_linked_list(shy_guy)
# # Example Output:

# # Current List:
# # shy_guy -> diddy_kong -> dry_bones

# Problem 3: Insert Node as Second Element
# Write a function add_second() that takes in the head of a linked list and a value val as parameters. It should insert val as the second node in the linked list and return the head of the linked list. (You can assume head is not None.)

# Note: The "head" of a linked list is the first element in the linked list. It is equivalent to lst[0] of a normal list.

# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, value, next=None):
#         self.value = value
#         self.next = next
    
# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(head):
#     current = head
#     while current:
#         print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
#         current = current.next

# def add_second(head, val):
#     head.next = Node(val, head.next)
#     return head
# # Example Usage:

# original_list_head = Node("banana")
# second = Node("blue shell")
# third = Node("bullet bill")
# original_list_head.next = second
# second.next = third


# # Linked list: "banana" -> "blue shell" -> "bullet bill"
# new_list = add_second(original_list_head , "red shell")
# print_linked_list(new_list)
# # Example Output:

# # banana -> red shell -> blue shell -> bullet bill




# # Problem 4: Increment Linked List Node Values
# # Write a function increment_ll() that takes in the head of a linked list of integer values and returns the same list, but with each node's value incremented by 1. Return the head of the list.

# class Node:
#     def __init__(self, value, next=None):
#         self.value = value
#         self.next = next

# # For testing
# def print_linked_list(head):
#     current = head
#     while current:
#         print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
#         current = current.next

# def increment_ll(head):
#     increment = head
#     while increment:
#         increment.value+=1
#         print(increment.value , end=" -> " if increment.next else "\n")
#         increment = increment.next
        
# # Example Usage:

# node_one = Node(5)
# node_two = Node(6)
# node_three = Node(7)
# node_one.next = node_two
# node_two.next = node_three

# # Input List: 5 -> 6 -> 7
# print_linked_list(increment_ll(node_one))
# # Example Output:

# # 6 -> 7 -> 8


# Problem 5: Copy Linked List
# Write a function copy_ll() that takes in the head of a linked list and creates a complete copy of that linked list.

# The function should return the head of a new linked list which is identical to the given list in terms of its structure and contents, but does not use any of the node objects from the original list.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def copy_ll(head):
    current = head
    new_head = None
    while current:
        new_node = Node(current.value)
        if not new_head:
            new_head = new_node
        if current.next:
            new_node.next = Node(current.next.value)
        current = current.next
    return new_head

    
# Example Usage:

mario = Node("Mario")
daisy = Node("Daisy")
luigi = Node("Luigi")
mario.next = daisy
daisy.next = luigi

# Linked List: Mario -> Daisy -> Luigi
copy = copy_ll(mario)

# Change original list -- should not affect the copy
mario.value = "Original Mario"

print_linked_list(mario)
print_linked_list(copy) 
# Example Output:

# Original Mario -> Daisy -> Luigi
# Mario -> Daisy -> Luigi
